Here, we can found options for language, logging and default chat. Also, here you can see experiments. We return to this sub-section later.  
* `language` - Allows to change language for plugin.
* `enable-logging` - Enables logging of EVERY chat to console.
* `default` - chat, that will be used by default.
## `chats` section.{#config.yml/chats}
Here you can change or add chats and settings. As example, we use global, and admin chats.
```yml
# ... other sections ...
chats:
  global:
    template: "global.yml" # Template for global chat. You can use formats like json (WIP)
    prefix: "!" # Prefix for use global chat. By default, and most popular — "!".
    radius: -1 # If -1 or 0 — global.
    perm: "" # If not set or just empty, will allow everyone to use this chat
  local:
    template: "local.yml" # Template for local chat.
    prefix: "" # Not set cause isn't need.
    radius: 100
  whisper:
    template: "whisper.yml"
    prefix: ["*", "_", "~"] # Supports aliases
    radius: 10
    perm: "" # If not set or just empty, will allow everyone to use this chat
  # Example chat with perms - Admin chat.
  #admin:
  #  template: "admin.yml"
   # prefix: [":", "^"]
   # perm: "lazychat.admin" # Able for set perm for chat. If not set, perm will be = none.
    # If player do not have perm — He cannot read and send messages in this chat. If he try — in chat will send only text with prefix that DO NOT work.
  # Example chat - Business chat.
  #business:
  #  template: "business.json"
  #  prefix: ["$", ";"]

# ... other sections ...
```
### global{#config.yml/chats/global}

* `prefix` - symbol/word that allows to use chat. In this case
* `radius` - radius (in blocks), on that your message will sent. In this case - `-1`, will sent message to global chat.
